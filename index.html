                    <h2>Ramen</h2>
                    <p>Ramen originated from China and was introduced to Japan in the late 19th  century by Chinese immigrants. Initially a simple street food, it  evolved in Japan to include various regional variations like Shoyu,  Tonkotsu, and Miso ramen. After WWII, Japan's economic boom saw the  proliferation of ramen shops and the invention of instant ramen by  Momofuku Ando in 1958, making it accessible worldwide. Today, ramen  enjoys global popularity with a thriving culture of gourmet creations  and festivals.</p>
